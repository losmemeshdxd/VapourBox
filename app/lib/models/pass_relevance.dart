///   film dirt, scratches, grain and over-sharpening are all invisible to
///   ffprobe, so the app has nothing to say about them and says nothing.
/// - **Never reorder, never disable.** The pass list's order is the order the
///   passes run in, and a [notApplicable] pass stays enabled and editable —
///   detection is a hint, not an authority, and it is wrong often enough
///   (`ScanType.unknown` exists for a reason) that overriding the user would
